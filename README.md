# Example Mecanum Drive for FRC
This repo has all the code needed to run a basic mecanum drive robot.

The purpose of this is to provide an easy and well documented example to help new Programmers understand WPILIB.

The actual code is in ./src/main/java/frc.robot. I would start in robot container and then go through the subsystems and commands.
Enjoy.

(NOTE: this code is untested and there is a possibility that it is not 100% functional. However, it still shows the rough structure of a robot codebase. If you see an issue open an issue on this repo or submit a pull request.)

(Another Note: This example was made for VERN (team: 5461) Programmers. Private VERN repos are mentioned as references. If you are a VERN programmer and need access to the repos, ask Randy or Brad to add you.)

The VERN repos to look at are ChargedUp2023 and Its-Pauls-Fault (yes this is a dumb joke pls don't overuse it since Paul might be getting a bit tired of it).
NOTE: When looking at the ChargedUp2023 repo, make sure to be on the dev branch instead on the main branch. Much of our code never was merged to main.
